G.A.N.P.I. â†’ Gemini-Assisted Natural Processing Interface
ðŸ§­ 1. Core Idea Recap
Youâ€™ll build a CLI tool that lets users type natural language commands like:
$ smartcli "Find all PDF files in Downloads and zip them into documents.zip"
Gemini interprets that text â†’ returns a structured description (or even the exact shell command) â†’ your C++ program executes it.
Result: clean, intelligent automation without memorizing complex shell syntax.
ðŸ”¥ Demo tip: Pick 3 flashy commands to show off during judging (e.g., image operations, file organization, batch renaming).
